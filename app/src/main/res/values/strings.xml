    <string name="overview_card_1_paragraph">First, you\'ll need to submerge each test strip in the water you\'re testing. Each test strip needs to be treated differently, so we\'ll test one at a time and go through the process together. For the best results, make sure you follow the instructions as closely as possible. The whole process will take about 5 minutes.</string>
    <string name="overview_card_2_paragraph">For each test strip, after you\'ve submerged it and waited for the correct amount of time, you\'ll need to place the strip on the test card and take a picture. Try to place the test strip as straight as possible on top of the marker on the card.</string>
    <string name="overview_card_3_paragraph">After you\'ve tested all the strips, we\'ll analyze the pictures and tell you about your water quality. We\'ll also upload the data to a cloud server where we can study trends in water bodies worldwide. Your\'re helping contribute to a World Water Health Map!</string>
