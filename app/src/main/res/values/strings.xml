        Gather a water sample in a container you\'d be comfortable drinking from.
        To test your water sample, you\'ll need to submerge an entire test strip in the water for about 1 second.
        Take it out, start the timer in the app, and place the strip on the test card.
        Make sure it is oriented as shown on the test card.
        Try to place the test strip as straight as possible in the space indicated on the card.
    </string>
    <string name="overview_card_3_paragraph">
        When the timer ends, the app will enable you to take a picture of the strip and card.
        We\'ll analyze that image and tell you about your water quality.
        We\'ll also upload the data to a cloud server where we can study trends in water bodies worldwide!
        You will be contributing to a World Water Health Map!
